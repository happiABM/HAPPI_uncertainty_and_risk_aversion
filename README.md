# Happi-Uncertainty And Risk Aversion
Welcome to the repository for the updated version of the Happi model. The Happi model is an agent-based model specifically designed to explore the low-carbon transition of the power system, developed using Python and Mathmatica.


**About the Model**

The Happi is a computamodel tool for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of the power system during its low-carbon transition. It employs  agent-based modeling techniques to simulate investors' investment decisions in new power plants.


**Model Update**

The main update in this version of Happi is the incorporation of uncertainties in CO2 price and risk averse behavior of investors.These new features enhance the model's ability to realistically simulate the decision-making processes in a fluctuating market environment.
[A detailed description of each Python file and their functionalities will be coming soon to this site.]
